Converts dtape and ktape to timeline.tpl.ckd.

How to use it:
- Insert your dtape and ktape into the 'input' folder. (Must be in json layout)
- Insert your msms for your map into 'input/msm'.
- If you are modding on kinect, you can do the same step as the previous one but use gestures instead. Remember to put it in 'input/gesture'.
- If you are replacing maps, go to your dtape in the 'input' folder and rename your mapname at the bottom. If you are doing custom bundles, you can skip this step.
- Run the tool and type in your mapname.
- You should be able to recieve your timeline.tpl.ckd in the 'output' folder as well as your msms that is being formatted to function well for your scoring.
- Put in in your mod.
